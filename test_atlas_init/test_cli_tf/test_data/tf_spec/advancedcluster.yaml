If not, MongoDB Cloud creates them as part of the deployment. It assigns the VPC a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block. To limit a new VPC peering connection to one Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block and region, create the connection first. Deploy the cluster after the connection starts.
